# Logic Programming in Prolog
This repository contains a collection of examples and exercises in logic programming using the Prolog language. Prolog is a logic-based programming language that allows you to represent and reason about problems using a set of rules and facts. <br>
Prolog 1 <br>
1. All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Hence(prin urmare), Socrates is mortal. <br>
2. Represent the following in Prolog: <br>
  a. Butch is a killer.<br>

  f. Jules eats anything nutritious or tasty.<br>

  b. Create a sibling rule.<br>
  c. Create a cousin rule.<br>
  d. Create aunt and uncle relations. <br>
Prolog 2 <br>
1. Parsing a list. <br>
2. Check if is a list. <br>
3. Append a list to another list. <br>
4. Naive rec reverse list. <br>
5. Accumulator rec reverse list. <br>
6. Another accumulator example. <br>
7. Accumulator based. <br>
8. Adding up a list of numbers. <br>
9. Given facts such as:<br>
Bob is taller than Mike.<br>
Mike is taller than Jim.<br>
Jim is taller than George.<br>
Write a recursive program that will determine that Bob's height is greater than George's.<br>
10. Get elements on the n-th position in a given list.<br>
11. Check if a list is a prefix of another list. Check if a list is a suffix of another list.<br>
12. Add one to each element of a list.
